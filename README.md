# Algolia Search Plugin for Pelican

These days Steve from [AgilityNerd](https://www.agilitynerd.com/) wondered if you'd ever posted my plugin's source for others to use?
He couldn't find a link in my post: [Finally - Pelican with Algolia Search](https://devops.datenkollektiv.de/finally-pelican-with-algolia-search.html).

Finally, the promised source code :)

> Note: I promised to polish and publish the source in case of interest.
Well, forget about the polishing part...
